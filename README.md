 ## **Python Flask Expert Assistant**

### **Problem Analysis**
The problem at hand is to build a web application that displays the most recent scores in major American sports. To achieve this, we will design a Flask application that fetches the scores from a reliable data source and presents them in a user-friendly manner.

### **Flask Application Structure**
The Flask application will consist of the following components:

- **HTML Files:**
  - `index.html`: This will be the main page of the application, displaying the most recent scores.
  - `sports.html`: This page will list all the major American sports that the application supports.
  - `scoreboard.html`: This page will display the scores for a specific sport, along with additional details such as the teams involved, date, and time.

- **Routes:**
  - `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page, displaying the most recent scores.
  - `/sports`: This route will render the `sports.html` page, listing all the supported sports.
  - `/scores/<sport>`: This route will render the `scoreboard.html` page, displaying the scores for the specified sport.

### **HTML Files**

#### **index.html**
This file will serve as the landing page of the application. It will display a summary of the most recent scores in major American sports. The content of this page may include:

- A heading or title indicating "Recent Scores" or "Sports Scores Today."
- A list of sports with links to their respective scoreboards (e.g., "/scores/basketball," "/scores/baseball," etc.).
- A brief description or tagline explaining the purpose of the application.

#### **sports.html**
This file will list all the major American sports supported by the application. The content of this page may include:

- A heading or title indicating "Sports."
- A list of sports with links to their respective scoreboards (e.g., "/scores/basketball," "/scores/baseball," etc.).
- A short description of each sport, providing additional context or information.

#### **scoreboard.html**
This file will display the scores for a specific sport. The content of this page may include:

- A heading or title indicating the sport's name (e.g., "Basketball Scores").
- A table presenting the scores, including columns for teams, scores, date, and time.
- Additional details or statistics related to the sport, such as standings, upcoming matches, or player statistics.

### **Routes**

#### **Route: /**
This route will handle requests to the root URL of the application and render the `index.html` page.

```python
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")
```

#### **Route: /sports**
This route will handle requests to the `/sports` URL and render the `sports.html` page.

```python
@app.route("/sports")
def sports():
    return render_template("sports.html")
```

#### **Route: /scores/<sport>**
This route will handle requests to the `/scores/<sport>` URL, where `<sport>` is the name of the sport. It will render the `scoreboard.html` page, displaying the scores for the specified sport.

```python
@app.route("/scores/<sport>")
def scoreboard(sport):
    scores = get_scores(sport)  # Function to fetch scores from a data source
    return render_template("scoreboard.html", sport=sport, scores=scores)
```

### **Additional Considerations**

- The application should incorporate a mechanism to periodically update the scores to ensure they remain current.
- Error handling should be implemented to gracefully handle cases where scores cannot be fetched or the requested sport is not supported.
- The application should follow best practices for web development, such as proper input validation and secure data handling.

By following this design, you can build a functional Flask application that meets the requirements of the problem statement.
